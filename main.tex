\section{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}

In this project, a 3 oscillator, MIDI compatible synthesizer was built, along with a self-complete PWM based synthesizer. The PWM-based synthesizer features mostly consistent waveforms, a low I/O pin count, and is powered directly through the microprocessor. The 3 oscillator version unfortunately suffered from numerous hardware and software limitations, mainly due to the speed of the microprocessor, the number of I/O available, and the number of ADCs available for use. Although it was concluded that the 3 oscillator synthesizer was not in working enough condition due to these limitations, the PWM-based synthesizer was playable. The 3 oscillator version functioned well as a noise generator and experimental synthesizer. Both versions of the synthesizer would offer more use as a low frequency oscillator due to such limitations, but nonetheless hold use within an analog synthesizer setup.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

% [introduction here]
Exploration into the possibility of creating a user-controlled, MIDI\footnote{musical instrument digital interface}-compatible fully featured synthesizer has held a personal interest shortly after I became interested in music production itself.
Motivation for this project to encompass this personal interest stemmed from first using pulse width modulation to change the brightness of a bulb during an earlier lab.
Since my more recent interest in analog audio equipment itself, I was motivated to do an audio-related project.
The purpose of this project, as a result, was to help me gain a further understanding into the inner workings of oscillators and envelope generators, gain an appreciation for the MIDI standard, and of course to have a working, hand-made synthesizer for future music production related use.
All three areas of knowledge mentioned above would aid in future audio-related projects, both in software as well as in hardware, and help inspire for future related projects.
This project builds off of my previous related experience in music production, which provided me with a background on audio synthesis and processing.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

% How did the device perform? Did it work according to the expectations? Comparison of theory to results obtained (as quantitative as possible). Problems encountered, graph(s) of data obtained, if appropriate, accuracy of the device (if it is a measuring instrument).
Unfortunately, the 3 oscillator version did not work properly due to software limitations.
When iterating through the different waveforms, the period set in the for loop was wildly inaccurate.
This was due to largely hardware-based fluctuations, as I did not use a timer to ensure accuracy of the period being set.
Hence, the actual period was based on the number of CPU cycles that were executed, which changed based on the period due to numerous factors.
Some of these factors include the use of multiplication, division, and modulo, which were not available in the MSP430G2553 microprocessor on a hardware level (no hardware multiplier, for example) and thus were computationally expensive.
Because there was this large computational overhead, not only was the waveform itself inaccurate, but the MIDI data was unable to be processed in a timely manner given it required quick turnaround time due to a fast baud rate of 31.25 k bits per seconds. The MIDI also did not work due to accidental frying of the MIDI Out port on the Edirol UA 25-EX, where it was treated as a MIDI In port and was being sent 5 volts when it should not have. This lead to spotty USB connection\footnote{This may have instead been due to transportation of the audio interface to the lab and back.}.
The 3 oscillator version was therefore only able to act as a noise generator, and was not able to be used as a semi-realistic synthesizer due to its inability to hold higher frequency synthesis. But, changing the period every iteration did lead to interesting results:

\begin{lstlisting}

void main() {
    // [setup code here, omitted for redundancy]
    period = 2; // modifiable value
    while(1) {
        period += 1; // modifiable value
        period %= 200; // modifiable value
        // [synthesis code / for loop here, omitted for redundancy]
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This lead to more "experimental" sounding synthesis, similar to what would be found in some Eurorack modules. Without MIDI support (as discussed directly above), however, and not enough ADCs available on the microprocessor for parameter changes, there would not have been nearly enough user interaction to make something that is enjoyable to use without going in and editing the C code, a task which is obviously not friendly to an end user, and inconvenient at best. 

Nonetheless, the PWM based, single oscillator version was much more accurate than the 3 oscillator version.
The PWM based version was able to accurately reproduce a square wave with a given period, mainly due to the fact that the PWM is based on a timer, which is able to accurately set the period and is also not based on the number of CPU cycles.

We can observe the accuracy and fluctuation of the PWM waveform by connecting the output of our synthesizer to the input of an audio interface, which allows the input to be observed through signal analysis software. Presonus Studio One's Spectrum Analyzer was used to analyze the waveform. 

Firstly, let's visualize A4 (at what should be 440 Hz), in Figure~\ref{fig:pwm440}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{FFTA4V2.png}
    \caption{FFT transform of the PWM synthesizer, playing at A4. }
    \label{fig:pwm440}
\end{figure}

Given the output is a square wave, we can compare this to a square wave generated using a software tone generator (also built into Studio One), both with and without antialiasing (figure \ref{fig:tone440aa} and \ref{fig:tone440naa} respectively). 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{FFT440AA.png}
    \caption{FFT transform of a square wave at 440 Hz with antialiasing. }
    \label{fig:tone440aa}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{FFT440NAA.png}
    \caption{FFT transform of a square wave at 440 Hz with no antialiasing. }
    \label{fig:tone440naa}
\end{figure}

% does studio one have an oscilloscope?

From what we can see here, the low pass filter did a good job at performing rudimentary antialiasing. However, the PWM period is actually off -- Even though 440 Hz (2273 $\mu$s) was selected as the period, as we see in the for loop in Section \ref{sec:appendix-d:-pwm-synthesizer-code}, the actual frequency is at approximately 504 Hz, which is closer to B rather than A. 

Note that the signal to noise ratio is much higher on the software tone generator, so on the PWM square wave, there is a much more visible noise floor, but nonetheless the signal can still be analyzed accordingly. In fact, we can directly view the noise floor coming from the synthesizer in Figure~\ref{fig:noisefloor}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{FFTnoisefloor.png}
    \caption{FFT transform of the noise floor coming from the PWM synthesizer. }
    \label{fig:noisefloor}
\end{figure}

The distortion of the PWM wave did change based on the note that was being played, as an inherent property of not using precision resistors and going through numerous conversions before turning into an audible output. A4, when played, did not have much distortion - this is juxtaposed with B4, which, as we will see in Figure~\ref{fig:fftb4}, has a much more distorted signal and did not sound as pleasant when played. The [software] tone generated signal for B4 is very similar to that of A4, and will be omitted for space's sake. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{FFTB4.png}
    \caption{FFT transform of the PWM synthesizer, playing at B4. }
    \label{fig:fftb4}
\end{figure}

% [ADD ANALYSIS OF FFT GRAPHS HERE]

We see that there are 2 conflicting notes that are being played (that are very close to each other). B4 was not always a poorly synthesized note: Dependent on placement of the synthesizer and resistor placement, the voltage level fluctuated repeatedly between the different bounds for a given note, hence why we see the fluctuating voltage here. This is an inherent flaw in the buttons to DAC to ADC to period translation. 


\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

% Discuss what went well, and what could have been better, possible improvements to the device.

It would have been a much better idea to use 3 PWM signals instead of 3 iterative waveforms, and modify the period and duty cycle accordingly to match the given waveform being played.
This would have allowed for a much more accurate representation of the waveform being played, and would have allowed for the use of a timer to accurately set the duty cycle.
Of course, this may have had its own limitations as well, as we would have to be accurately changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal, and this would have required another timer to be used, along with numerous interrupts (in order to use the PWM as a non-square wave).
This may have been a better idea, but still is at risk of being too computationally expensive due to the constant changing of the duty cycle with a semi-unknown period (due to the fact that we have so many notes that could be played). 
Early analog synthesizers combated this problem, and simultaneously allowed for polyphony, by using a separate waveform generator for each note.
But alas, this is too expensive for our microprocessor, and the 3 oscillator version was not able to be used as a real-time synthesizer, and the PWM based version was not "interesting" enough for real-world use (albeit was much more accurate and actually playable).

The primary source of inaccuracy for the PWM based version was the DAC being used to convert the notes being pressed to an analog signal.
Precision resistors were not used, and so a lot of fluctuation was observed in the analog input signal.
This is especially observed in Figure~\ref{fig:fftb4}. 
This could have also been mitigated somewhat by using an integrated circuit instead of a resistor ladder DAC, as the resistor ladder was very reactive to external conditions. During the in-class demonstration, for example, B4 was just fine in its frequency consistency, whereas D5 was hugely fluctuating and distorted, which interfered somewhat with the demonstration. 

A possible improvement that could be made is to use this module - either the 3 oscillator version or the PWM version - as not a synthesizer, but instead an LFO (low frequency oscillator), which could have been used as a module in another synthesizer application, or even as a Eurorack module. Other improvements would be to use precision resistors to ensure a more consistent frequency input, or an integrated circuit DAC, as discussed above. It would also lead to a more interesting output if the output was split, with one split being smoothed using a capacitor, and the other as-is, and mixing the two together using a variable resistor (thus having two somewhat different waveforms to play with). And of course, having proper MIDI compatibility - perhaps by doing the decoding on another microprocessor - would have made the synthesizer more playable. 

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

% Was it worth constructing? What did you learn?

The most important thing that was learned is that the MSP430 is not powerful enough to be used for accurate audio reproduction. Hardware limitations were often overlooked in the design of the synthesizer, leading to numerous issues and inaccuracies as described in Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:discussion}. This project was certainly a learning experience, and being aware of such limitations will make a future design of a synthesizer a more successful endeavour. As such, the project was certainly worth constructing as a learning experience. The design of this project lead to more knowledge in decoding MIDI data, envelope and waveform generation, and circuit design. The 3 oscillator synthesizer still has use as an LFO, and with some tuning of the output frequency, could be used as such so long as MIDI data is decoded elsewhere.

\section{Appendix: Initial Design Sketches}

Attached below are the initial design sketches for the synthesizer, as well as the design sketch for the PWM based version. Note that the initial design sketch did not take into account the hardware limitations of the MSP430 only having 2 ADCs available, and incorporated the use of multiple inputs. 

With regards to the PWM design, the diodes ended up not being needed due to no longer splitting the output, and the note on/off was handled through software instead of going through a phototransistor NOT gate (not explicitly shown). 

The sketches are included as reference only, and hence are not computer-generated. Necessary details regarding the circuit diagrams are in the corresponding figures in Section \ref{sec:apparatus}.
